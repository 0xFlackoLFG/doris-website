Apache Doris is a MPP-based interactive SQL data warehousing for reporting and analysis. 

Apache Doris mainly integrates the technology of Google Mesa and Apache Impala. 
Unlike other popular SQL-on-Hadoop systems, Apache Doris is designed to be a simple and single tightly coupled system, not depending on other systems. Apache Doris not only provides high concurrent low latency point query performance, but also provides high throughput queries of ad-hoc analysis. 

Apache Doris not only provides batch data loading, but also provides near real-time mini-batch data loading. 

Apache Doris also provides high availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability. The simplicity (of developing, deploying and using) and meeting many data serving requirements in single system are the main features of Apache Doris.
